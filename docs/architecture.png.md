# Architecture Diagram (PNG)

To include a professional diagram in your GitHub Pages, you can use the ASCII diagram in `architecture.md` or generate a PNG using a tool like [diagrams.net](https://diagrams.net/) or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/).

**Recommended steps:**

1. Copy the ASCII diagram from `docs/architecture.md`.
2. Paste it into diagrams.net or Excalidraw and style as desired.
3. Export as `architecture.png` and place it in the `docs/` folder.
4. Reference it in `docs/index.md`:
   ```markdown
   ![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)
   ```
